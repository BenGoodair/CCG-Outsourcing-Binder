# CCG-Outsourcing-Binder

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/BenGoodair/CCG-Outsourcing-Binder/HEAD)

Welcome to my Binder repository for the upcoming paper in the Lancet Public Health, co-authored with Aaron Reeves: 'Outsourcing healthcare services to the private sector and treatable mortality rates in England, 2013-2020: An observational study of NHS privatisation.'

To launch the Binder application click the Binder button at the top of this README file or click the link [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/BenGoodair/CCG-Outsourcing-Binder/HEAD).

After 15 minutes a Jupyter launcher should load. If you have R downloaded on your device you should be able to open an RStudio launcher.

Then open the Rmd file for the paper from within the RStudio interface by clicking on the 'R' folder in the files panel.

This should then run smoothly for you, using the package versions as used when the paper was written.

Please feel free to give me feedback or ask questions at benjamin.goodair@spi.ox.ac.uk
